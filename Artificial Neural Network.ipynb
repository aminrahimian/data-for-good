    "\n",
    "Under the background of biology, in the nervous system, our brain contains billions of neurons. In the system, the neurons send the information down to the axon until the axon terminals (electric signals), and then the signal is transformed to chemical signals and is sent to the next neuron. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of artificial neural network (ANN) is based on the concept of the biological neural network. In ANN, there are several layers that contain some number of neurons, where each layer has different roles. Similar to the biological one, ANN receives the input information (x variables), sends the information based on the importance of each information to the next neuron, and finally outputs the signal (y variable)"

    "\n",
    "The input layer is the layer that inputs the signals (data) into the network (The number of neurons inside it is the number of attributes that we are interested in). The output layer is the layer that outputs the signal (y variables). Between the input layer and the output layer, there is/are some hidden layer(s) that contains some number of neurons. Like the biological neuron, each dendrite’s signal is weighted according to its importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Activation Functions*\n",
    "\n",
    "In each hidden layer, there is an activation function to transform the input information (a technique to increase the nonlinearity of the model). For example, if the activation function in hidden layer L1 is $f$, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align = 'center'><font size = '6'>${A_k}^{(1)}=f(w_{k0}+\\sum_{j=1}^p w_{kj}X_j)$</font></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $w_{kj}$ is the weight between the previous neuron $j$ and the current neuron $k$, which reveals the importance of the data being sent (and needs to be estimated by the model). $w_{k0}$ is the bias weight. When the information is propagating, each neuron will sum all the information that it receives (i.e., all the information $X_j$ as well as its importance $w_{kj}$), then it will do a nonlinear transformation by using activation function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The form of the activation function is flexible. Generally, some common activation functions are sigmoid, ReLU, $tanh(x)$, etc. Unfortunately, like SVM, there is not a following rule to choose the activation function (thus we need to define them by ourselves in the model)\n",

    "\n",
    "The ability of a neural network to learn is rooted in its topology. The characteristics of a network are the number of layers, whether the information is allowed to be sent backward and the number of neurons within each layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the models we learned before, ANN has a tradeoff: the more complex the neural network, the more accurate we will predict on our training data, while we may face the problem of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Study the weights*\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the linear regression, we have a criterion function that the model must minimize while it is being trained (like the least square function). In machine learning, this function is called the cost function. \n",
    "The cost function of the weights:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align = 'center'><font size = '6'>$J(\\vec{w})=\\frac{1}{2n}\\sum_{i=1}^n ((\\sum_{j=1}^p w_jx_j)-y_i)^2$</font></div>\n",

    "\n",
    "To minimize the cost function, we can adjust the weights to decrease the value of the cost function. Remember the definition of the gradient, we can find out the steepest function that the cost function would decrease. Then we can adjust the weights by a small amount which is determined by the learning rate. We keep adjusting the weights until it reaches to the minimal. (Imagine a person is at the top of a mountain that wants to go downhill. Each time the person moves a little bit along the steepest direction down the hill) This process is called gradient descent."

    "- The amount to be adjusted is determined by the learning rate. If the learning rate is too small, it spends a large amount of time to reach the optimal; if it is too large, it may cause the weights to change too drastically oscillating between values, and so again the learning algorithm will either take too long to converge or oscillate continuously.\n",
    "- When the cost function is non-convex, we may finally reach out a local minimum. (Thus we need to use stochastic gradient descent, with stochastic initialization)\n"

    "After you run the R code, notice the final result of the accuracy. The ANN gives us a **73.7%** accuracy on predicting whether one person will smoke. However, when we compare the accuracy based on gender, the model predicts well on female with the accuracy of **95.7%** while it is only **46.2%** for male, which is worse than we threw a coin and take a random guess. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very serious bias that occasionally occurs in artificial neural networks. Imagine if an insurance company is considering the Premium of a person. Instead of calculating by humans, they use this neural network to determine whether the premium of lung-disease insurance should be increased. It is undoubtedly that this algorithm is discriminatory toward males and the premium it predicts is not accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "One intractable problem of neural networks is that the math behind them is too sophisticated. The model is considered a \"black-box\" model because most of the time it only gives you a prediction and an accuracy without any explanation. It is very sensitive if the network considers some attributes and comes out with bias and slant, such as imbalanced premium of lung disease based on gender biased, one's acquittal based on race biased if neural networks are being used. Consequently, it is essential to be careful when using a black box model because no one will trust a result without any reasoning, even though the accuracy is perfect. \n",

    "It seems to provide a good accuracy by using the neural network system when testing in the previous records. However, because of the Machine Bias, the system is unfair for some groups of people espeacially when it comes to gender, race and age. Similar to what you have seen from the previous prediction on smoking status, Machine Bias can create sensitive bias and does not consider about out human rights. Thus, it is necessary to focus on it whenever we use a neural network to predict. \n",
