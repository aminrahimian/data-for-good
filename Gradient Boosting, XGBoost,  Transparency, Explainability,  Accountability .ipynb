    "Gradient boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used in regression and classification tasks, among others. It gives a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, which are typically decision trees.When a decision tree is the weak learner, the resulting algorithm is called gradient-boosted trees; it usually outperforms random forest.A gradient-boosted trees model is built in a stage-wise fashion as in other boosting methods, but it generalizes the other methods by allowing optimization of an arbitrary differentiable loss function.\n",
