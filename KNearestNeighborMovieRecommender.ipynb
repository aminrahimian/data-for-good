    "### What is K Nearest Neighbor?\n",
    "K Nearest Neighbor is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is ideal for data mining because it does not perform any calculations with the training data, it just stores the data. Once a query is performed on the dataset, the algorithm will build the appropriate model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of application**: stock market prediction, bank loan approval, pattern recognition, and online shopping ad recommendations, facility location\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does K Nearest Neighbors work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./fig/KNN/fig1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN uses a distance based function (ie. euclidean) to calculate the similarity between the test instance and the existing points on the model graph.\n",
    "KNN essentially has a voting mechanism to determine the class that a data point belongs to. The class with the most votes wins and the point is assigned to that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN doesn't make assumptions about the underlying statistical distribution that the data may have.\n",
    "Ex: In the movie recommender algorithm cosine similarity is being used as the distance function\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./fig/KNN/fig2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two types of problems:**\n",
    "**Classification-** The input instances (from the training data) are classified based on their discrete class labels (whatever parameter we are trying to predict). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Regression-** The input instances are used to predict a non-discrete number (such as predicting a person’s weight given their height, age, and gender)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What assumptions are made?**\n",
    "The algorithm assumes that data points clustered near each other are similar and therefore have the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are the issues that these assumptions can cause?**\n",
    "The accuracy depends on the quality of the data or the test instance data will not be accurately classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros of K-Nearest Neighbors:**\n",
    "- It can handle multi-class data\n",
    "- It can flexibly handle different distance functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the difference between K-Nearest Neighbors and K-Means**\n",
    "KNN is a supervised algorithm used for classification or regression based on feature similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means is an unsupervised algorithm used for clustering of data points with no prelabeled class. It divides the data points into “similar” groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example applications:** Delivery route optimization, ride share app analysis to identify traffic patterns throughout the day, Automatic clustering of IT alerts for prioritization\n",

    "**Unsupervised learning:** The algorithm is trained using data without class labels.\n",
    "Types of problems: clustering and association\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning:** The algorithm must make the decision with the best future knowledge outcome. The model learns by getting feedback on the past decision outcomes.\n",
    "Types of problems: Exploitation or exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "**The exploitation-exploration tradeoff:**\n",
    "Article By professional data engineer: https://ekababisong.org/the-exploration-exploitation-trade-off/ \n",
    "The objective is to maximize the cumulative reward. The agent can either exploit the known optimal action (given what is already known) or explore the unknown and potentially be rewarded with new information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploitation:** To choose the action that seems optimal, given the information already known.\n",
    "Example in movie database: Should we recommend more popular movies to users? Netflix does this by recommending their top 10 trending shows/movies by country\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploration:** To make the less optimal decision, given the assumption that the information already known is inaccurate and learning more information could improve future decision making outcomes.\n",
    "Example in movie database: Should we take a risk and recommend less popular movies to users in order to get more ratings for them and learn more?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the movie industry a movie being “popular” could impact box office performance and award show consideration. Exploration could be advantageous to get more reviews for less popular movies, however this is a risk because we do not have as much information (number of ratings) to base this decision on. A streaming service such as Netflix may use exploitation within recommender systems to recommend movies they have produced to influence the popularity. ***add more to tie it to society***\n",

    "**Decision boundary** indicates where the cutoff for one class starts and another begins. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Model flexibility** is the model’s ability to increase the degrees of freedom available to the model in order to fit the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **flexible model** will have a greater number of estimation parameters and have a more non-linear decision boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **inflexible model** will have a lower number of estimation parameters and have a more linear decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "The smaller that K is, the more flexible (non linear) the decision boundary line will be. This corresponds to a classification model with low bias but very high variance. The model is finding patterns in the data that may or may not exist since K is so low.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a model’s flexibility decreases, variance will decrease and bias will increase. In order to have a model with the best fit we want to have low bias and low variance so the K we choose will need to be picked carefully. \n"
