    "# Get Ready on Trip!\n",
    "Here is the tutorial on how to use computer programming on your laptop. Programming is a tool for us to do analysis, and here we do not need to know the rudimentary ideas beneath it, so don't be panic.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you learn better in the following turorials, here are some paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to install\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will use both Python and R, since these two languages are the most popular ones that are being used for statistical analysis and data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You can simply install it from its website: https://www.python.org/downloads/\n",
    "You can also download Pycharm to open and edit the python files/projects with a more user-friendly interface: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can use Python by installing Anaconda (Recommended, https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads)\n",
    "\n",
    "### R\n",
    "\n",
    "Guidence of R installation: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Jupyter Notebook to Run the codes\n",
    "\n",
    "To install Jupyter Notebook in your computer, it is recommended to use Anaconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install it here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution#Downloads\n",
    "\n",
    "After you install the Anaconda, you can see that jupyter notebook is already installed there. Two ways to run it:\n",
    "1. Open the Anaconda Navigator, find the Jupyter Notebook and launch it\n",
    "2. Open the Anaconda Prompt, type \"jupyter notebook\", then press enter to run it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook has ipykernel already there for us to run the python code. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a little bit difficult to run R in jupyter notebook. It is recommended to use R studio instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to run R code in Jupyter Notebook, you must first install IRkernel.\n",
    "Here is a tutorial on it: https://datatofish.com/r-jupyter-notebook/\n",
    "\n",
    "To run both Python and R in one jupyter notebook, it is necessary to install rpy2 library.\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Install rpy2 by typing: \"pip install rpy2\"\n",
    "2. Add enviornment variables\n",
    "    - R_HOME: The root path of R. For example: C:\\Program Files\\R\\R-4.1.2\\\n",
    "    - R_USER: C:\\Users\\Administrator（The default user name）\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In the PATH, add:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - %R_HOME%\\bin\\x64\\R.dll（64 bits）\n",
    "    - %R_HOME%\\bin\\x64\n",
    "3. Check in Jupyter:\n",
    "    - !python -m rpy2.situation\n",
    "    - %load_ext rpy2.ipython (Each time before you run R code, you should run this one first)\n",
    "4. Usage\n",
    "    - To install package:\n",
    "        - %R install.packages('ggplot2')\n",
    "    - To interact between python and r:\n",
    "        - Cell 1:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        import pandas as pd\n",
    "        \n",
    "        df = pd.DataFrame({'x':[1,2,3],'y':[1,32,3]})\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Cell 2:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        %%R -i df -o data\n",
    "        \n",
    "        data=df\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \"%%\" means the cell is in R code, -i means input from python and -o means output\n",
